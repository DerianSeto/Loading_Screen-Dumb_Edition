# Loading_Screen-Dumb_Edition
A loading screen that took me way too long, and is still worthless. The reason being that it has no function unless I can find a way to prioritize loading.
Still looks cool, though. I want to scale it horizontally, so it goes out the sides. Maybe vertically, but that's just unnecessary.

Have fun with this one, I know I didn't.
